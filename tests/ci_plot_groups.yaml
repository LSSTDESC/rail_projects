# This file describes the groups of plots we can make with the rail_plotting module

# Where to find the plot definitions
- PlotterYaml:
      path: tests/ci_plots.yaml

# Where to find the dataset definitions
- DatasetYaml:
      path: tests/ci_datasets.yaml


# Each of these will back a group of plots, by taking the product of the
# plots in the name PlotterList with the datasets in the DatasetList

# Make plots of point estimates v. true redshifts
- PlotGroup:
      name: zestimate_v_ztrue_test_plots
      plotter_list_name: zestimate_v_ztrue
      dataset_dict_name: baseline_test

# Make plots of accuracy as a function of true redshift
- PlotGroup:
      name: accuracy_v_ztrue
      plotter_list_name: accuracy_v_ztrue
      dataset_dict_name: baseline_merged

# Make plots of n(z) in various tomographic bins
- PlotGroup:
      name: tomo_bins
      plotter_list_name: tomo_bins
      dataset_dict_name: blend_baseline_tomo_knn
