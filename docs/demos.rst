`rail_projects` comes with several notebooks that demonstrate how to use it to analyze data in a number of different ways.

Here we describe the various notebooks and suggest other ways in which you might study the data.


Demos
=====

We recommend starting with notebook this this notebook,
which demonstrates top-level rail project functionality, such as how to create a project from an example
configuration, and how to do simple things with such as reducing the input data, sub-selecting data to
make training and tests data sets and how to run simple analysis pipelines on those.

This notebook shows how to use a `RailProject` interactively to add a
new flavor and use it to run a pipeline.
